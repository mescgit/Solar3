Solar2-rs — Game Overview
Version Target: v1.0 (Playable Sandbox Simulation + Progression Loop)
Genre: Physics-driven sandbox / evolution sim / ambient experience
🎯 High-Level Goal

Solar2-rs is an open-ended physics sandbox inspired by Solar 2 — a game about growth through gravity.

The player begins as a small rock drifting through a living galaxy and evolves through absorption, collisions, and gravity-based growth into a planet, star, and eventually a black hole.
The universe itself is fully simulated using an N-body gravity solver (Barnes-Hut approximation for performance).
Each level of evolution unlocks new mechanics and challenges, but the core goal remains constant:

“Grow, survive, and witness the physics of creation.”

🧠 Core Loop

Move — Control your body’s trajectory using thrust, gravity, and momentum.

Absorb — Collide with smaller bodies to gain mass.

Evolve — Reach mass thresholds to evolve into new celestial classes (Planet → Star → Black Hole).

Adapt — Avoid dangerous collisions and environmental hazards that can destroy or destabilize you.

Explore — Spawn new systems, trigger chain reactions, and watch gravity sculpt complex motion.

Optional objectives (missions/scenarios) guide the player through increasingly chaotic simulations, but self-directed discovery is the heart of the experience.

⚙️ Systems Summary
1. Physics

Barnes-Hut quadtree gravity approximation

Stable leapfrog integration

Collision resolution:

Absorption (default)

Elastic (for debug/chaos modes)

Adaptive timestep for stability under extreme mass ratios

2. Body Classes
Class	Approx. Mass Range	Behavior	Visuals
Asteroid	< 500	passive, easily absorbed	pale blue/white
Planet	500–20k	medium gravity, sustains orbits	teal/cyan
Star	20k–1M	emits strong gravity, can destabilize belts	yellow/orange
Black Hole	>1M	extreme pull, absorbs all nearby	black with faint halo

3. Player

Controlled via WASD / Arrows / Shift for boost

Can absorb smaller bodies

Grows class as it gains mass

Death: colliding with a larger body or star

4. Universe Generation

Procedural ring systems and clusters

Adjustable density, seed, and system scale

“Scenario” presets: calm, chaotic, twin-star, cluster, debris storm

5. Visuals & UI

Particle trails behind moving bodies

Additive bloom/glow for luminous classes

HUD:

Body count, player mass/class

Simulation rate, FPS

Controls summary

Camera:

Follow player (toggle)

Smooth zoom to cursor

Right-drag pan

6. Progression & Objectives

Evolution milestones trigger:

Class transitions

Visual FX + sound cues

Optional “missions” (grow to X, survive Y seconds)

Win/Lose conditions:

Win: reach target mass or survive time limit

Lose: destroyed or merged by larger body

7. Performance Goals

Target: 10,000 bodies @ 60 FPS (RTX 4090)

Average playtest: 1,000–2,000 bodies at full speed

Optimizations:

Spatial hash for collisions

Barnes-Hut for gravity

Batched rendering

🧩 Design Pillars

Emergent Order from Chaos — simple rules, complex beauty.

Player as Participant, not Commander — you are one body among many.

No Menu-Driven Progression — evolution is physical, not numerical.

Sandbox First — everything reacts, everything persists.

Elegance in Simulation — every mechanic is a direct expression of physics.

🚀 Future Expansion (Post-1.0)

Planet systems (moons, orbit capture)

Procedural missions with dialogue

Audio ambience (reactive sound design)

GPU compute backend for massive-scale galaxies

Save/load & replay system

Steam/itch release with mod hooks

Tagline:

“You are gravity.
Watch the universe build itself around you.”
