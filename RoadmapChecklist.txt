v1.0 Roadmap (Solar2-rs)
Milestone 0 — Current Prototype ✅

Barnes-Hut gravity + belts render

Player body with thrust controls

    Collision/absorption stable at 2k bodies

Milestone 1 — Core Sim Polish (P0)

Upgrade integrator to full leapfrog (kick–drift–kick in 2 systems; cap velocity)
Done when: energy drift over 30s < 2% at default dt.

Adaptive softening & theta (scale with local density; UI sliders)
Done when: belts remain coherent across zoom levels.

Collision modes: absorb vs. elastic (restitution in settings)
Done when: toggle works; elastic conserves momentum within 2%.

Spatial hash tune (cell size auto = ~2× mean radius)
Done when: 10k bodies @ 60 FPS on 4090 at 1400×900.

    Determinism toggle (fixed seed; single-thread simulation set)
    Done when: identical replay hashes for 60s runs.

Milestone 2 — Camera & Input (P0)

Camera follow (toggle F) with smooth lerp + right-drag pan override

Zoom to cursor (world-space) with min/max scale clamps

Time controls: Space (pause), [/] (0.5×/1×/2×/4× sim rate), R (reset)

    Keybinds in settings (simple map; show in HUD)

Milestone 3 — Visuals & UX (P1)

Trails (low-alpha particles; lifespan/step configurable)

Glow/bloom: material or post-process; class-based color & alpha

Scale sprites by mass with smooth size animation

UI/HUD:

    bodies, player mass/class, sim rate, FPS

    mini help (controls), toggle with H

    Colorblind-safe palette (switchable)

Milestone 4 — Gameplay Loop (P0)

Growth tiers: Asteroid → Planet → Star → Black Hole (class thresholds)
Done when: sprite/FX and mechanics change at thresholds.

Absorption scoring: +mass, score = absorbed momentum/rarity

Threats/hazards: rogue stars, micro BHs, debris storms (spawn waves)

Objectives/Missions (Solar2-style vibes, minimal content):

    survive X seconds, reach class Y, absorb N planets, escort payload

    Win/Lose states: mission success screens; player death → retry

Milestone 5 — Content & Generation (P1)

Procedural systems: rings, binary stars, clusters (seeded)

Scenario presets: “Calm Belts”, “Binary Mayhem”, “Star Nursery”, “BH Arena”

    Seed entry UI + “Randomize” button

Milestone 6 — Performance & QA (P0)

10k bodies @ 60 FPS target on 4090; 30 FPS on mid-range GPU

Frame time budget telemetry (diagnostics overlay; toggle F3)

Allocator tweak (jemallocator feature flag)

    Hot reload settings (TOML/ron watched; dev-only)

Milestone 7 — Persistence & Replays (P1)

Save/Load seed + settings + bodies (position/vel/mass/class)

Short replay capture (circular buffer; export to JSON)

    Autosave on exit (optional)

Milestone 8 — Audio & Polish (P2)

Minimal SFX: absorb “pop”, star flare, BH hum (volume sliders)

UI sounds (toggle)

    Screen shake on big merges (micro, class-scaled)

Milestone 9 — Menus & Packaging (P0)

Main menu (Play, Scenarios, Options, Quit)

Options: graphics (bloom, trails), controls, gameplay, accessibility

Credits

Windows build (MSVC), zipped artifact + version string (SemVer)

    Crash-safe: panic hook with on-disk dump (dev-only)

Milestone 10 — v1.0 Definition (ship checklist)

Stable core sim with leapfrog + BH approximation, 10k@60fps on target HW

Camera follow/zoom, clean HUD, trails, glow/bloom toggle

Growth tiers + at least 5 objectives playable end-to-end

Save/Load, basic settings, keybinds

One procedural generator + 3 scenario presets

    Windows release artifact + README + controls/help

Nice-to-Have (post-1.0)

Steam/itch packaging, achievements

Mod hooks (load scenarios/settings from folder)

Photo mode (pause, hide HUD, slow shutter trails)

    GPU compute path (wgpu compute kernels) for >50k bodies

Order of Operations Suggestion

    Milestone 1 & 2 (physics + camera/input polish)

    Milestone 3 (visual feedback so play feels good)

    Milestone 4 (loop & objectives)

    Milestone 6 (perf) → Milestone 5 (content)

    Milestone 9 (menus) → Milestone 10 (ship)
