v1.0 Roadmap (Solar2-rs)
Milestone 0 — Current Prototype ✅

Team-specific breakdowns live in `docs/roadmaps/` for simulation, controls, and presentation owners.

✅ Barnes-Hut gravity + belts render

✅ Player body with thrust controls

✅ Collision/absorption stable at 2k bodies

Milestone 1 — Core Sim Polish (P0)

✅ Upgrade integrator to full leapfrog (kick–drift–kick in 2 systems; cap velocity)
Done when: energy drift over 30s < 2% at default dt.

✅ Adaptive softening & theta (scale with local density; UI sliders)
Done when: belts remain coherent across zoom levels.

✅ Collision modes: absorb vs. elastic (restitution in settings)
Done when: toggle works; elastic conserves momentum within 2%.

✅ Spatial hash tune (cell size auto = ~2× mean radius)
Done when: 10k bodies @ 60 FPS on 4090 at 1400×900.

✅ Determinism toggle (fixed seed; single-thread simulation set)
    Done when: identical replay hashes for 60s runs.

Milestone 2 — Camera & Input (P0)

✅ Camera follow (toggle F) with smooth lerp + right-drag pan override

✅ Zoom to cursor (world-space) with min/max scale clamps

✅ Time controls: Space (pause), [/] (0.5×/1×/2×/4× sim rate), R (reset)

🟡 Keybinds in settings (simple map; show in HUD)

Milestone 3 — Visuals & UX (P1)

🟡 Trails (low-alpha particles; lifespan/step configurable)

✅ Glow/bloom: material or post-process; class-based color & alpha

✅ Scale sprites by mass with smooth size animation

UI/HUD:

    ✅ bodies, player mass/class, sim rate, FPS

    ✅ mini help (controls), toggle with H

    ✅ Colorblind-safe palette (switchable)

Milestone 4 — Gameplay Loop (P0)

✅ Growth tiers: Asteroid → Planet → Star → Black Hole (class thresholds)
Done when: sprite/FX and mechanics change at thresholds.

✅ Absorption scoring: +mass, score = absorbed momentum/rarity

✅ Threats/hazards: rogue stars, micro BHs, debris storms (spawn waves)

🟡 Objectives/Missions (Solar2-style vibes, minimal content):

    survive X seconds, reach class Y, absorb N planets, escort payload

🟡 Win/Lose states: mission success screens; player death → retry

Milestone 5 — Content & Generation (P1)

✅ Procedural systems: rings, binary stars, clusters (seeded)

✅ Scenario presets: “Calm Belts”, “Binary Mayhem”, “Star Nursery”, “BH Arena”

⬜ Seed entry UI + “Randomize” button

Milestone 6 — Performance & QA (P0)

⬜ 10k bodies @ 60 FPS target on 4090; 30 FPS on mid-range GPU

✅ Frame time budget telemetry (diagnostics overlay; toggle F3)

⬜ Allocator tweak (jemallocator feature flag)

⬜ Hot reload settings (TOML/ron watched; dev-only)

Milestone 7 — Persistence & Replays (P1)

⬜ Save/Load seed + settings + bodies (position/vel/mass/class)

⬜ Short replay capture (circular buffer; export to JSON)

    ⬜ Autosave on exit (optional)

Milestone 8 — Audio & Polish (P2)

⬜ Minimal SFX: absorb “pop”, star flare, BH hum (volume sliders)

⬜ UI sounds (toggle)

    ⬜ Screen shake on big merges (micro, class-scaled)

Milestone 9 — Menus & Packaging (P0)

⬜ Main menu (Play, Scenarios, Options, Quit)

⬜ Options: graphics (bloom, trails), controls, gameplay, accessibility

⬜ Credits

⬜ Windows build (MSVC), zipped artifact + version string (SemVer)

    ⬜ Crash-safe: panic hook with on-disk dump (dev-only)

Milestone 10 — v1.0 Definition (ship checklist)

⬜ Stable core sim with leapfrog + BH approximation, 10k@60fps on target HW

🟡 Camera follow/zoom, clean HUD, trails, glow/bloom toggle

⬜ Growth tiers + at least 5 objectives playable end-to-end

⬜ Save/Load, basic settings, keybinds

🟡 One procedural generator + 3 scenario presets

    ⬜ Windows release artifact + README + controls/help

Nice-to-Have (post-1.0)

⬜ Steam/itch packaging, achievements

⬜ Mod hooks (load scenarios/settings from folder)

⬜ Photo mode (pause, hide HUD, slow shutter trails)

    ⬜ GPU compute path (wgpu compute kernels) for >50k bodies

Order of Operations Suggestion

    Milestone 1 & 2 (physics + camera/input polish)

    Milestone 3 (visual feedback so play feels good)

    Milestone 4 (loop & objectives)

    Milestone 6 (perf) → Milestone 5 (content)

    Milestone 9 (menus) → Milestone 10 (ship)
